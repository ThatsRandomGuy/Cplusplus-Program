For this project, the goal was to make a program that could take an input file and read how many times a specific item showed up. I think that the use of maps was a very important part of this project  and something  I integrated well, but I think I could have used just one for the backup data and options 2 and 3. While trying to use the same map however, I was running into a problem where either it would write to the backup file or ouput it to the screen not both. If I had found out a way to use the same map I think it would have greatly increased my overall conciseness. This was something I found to be a challenge but it was nothing stack overflow couldn't help me with. I can see myself using maps a lot in the future because of their ability to store multiple variables. By using in line comments, I think I made this project very readable and maintainable for future use. If something needs to be changed, it is easy to find. Overall, this was my favorite project to do because of how it used techniques that I am not very comfortable with. I look forward to exploring the uses of maps and other techniques in the future.
